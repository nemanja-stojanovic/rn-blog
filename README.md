# Blog app in React Native

## Instructions
`npm i` 

`npm start` 

This will install the dependencies and start the app with json-server but before using the app, we must expose our server and change base URL in source code.

We can do this with running the command `npm run tunnel` in a new window.

After that we must to manually copy the url from the new window into `baseURL` variable inside `src/api/jsonServer`.
