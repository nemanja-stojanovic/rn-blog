# Blog app in React Native

## Instructions
`npm i` 

`npm start` 

This will start the app and json-server but before using the app, we must expose our server and change base URL.

We can do this with running the command `npm run tunnel` in new window.

After that we must manually copy the url from the new window into `baseURL` variable inside `src/api/jsonServer`
